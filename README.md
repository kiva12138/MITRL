The codes for **Modality-Invariant Temporal Representation Learning**, published in journal ***Information Fusion***


To run the codes, define the data_paths in Dataset/UnifiedDataset.py, then run:

```bash
python TrainSimilarityWithLoss.py
```


For convenience, we ultilize the datasets the datasets in **Context-aware Interactive Attention for Multi-modal Sentiment and Emotion Analysis** (https://github.com/GussailRaat/EMNLP-19-IIM). You can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IVgdjfRGSqnai45ksot7UZ5C-1xJBBWZ?usp=sharing) (the link is also from the above repository).
